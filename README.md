# OncoShield: Cancer Genomics Dual-Use Risk Tool

## 🚨 Purpose

**OncoShield** is a secure, biosecurity-aware framework built for cancer researchers, hospitals, and biotech firms. It helps detect dual-use risks, synthetic constructs, or pipeline tampering in genomic workflows.

This tool addresses increasing concerns around misuse of cancer genomics data—particularly synthetic variants, engineered constructs, or manipulated diagnostic pipelines that could lead to misdiagnosis or biosecurity threats.

## 🔬 Core Functions

- **Synthetic Mutation Detection:** Identify known or engineered oncogenic patterns from COSMIC, Addgene, iGEM.
- **Secure Variant Calling:** Hardened variant-calling pipelines with cryptographic integrity and audit layers.
- **Red Team Module:** Simulate cancer mimicry, synthetic variant spiking, or malicious pipeline interventions.
- **Clinical Dashboard:** Highlight dual-use risk, pipeline tampering indicators, and diagnostic uncertainty.
